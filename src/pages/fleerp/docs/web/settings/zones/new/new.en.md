# Zones

The zones in the Fleerp system are a defined perimeter of the map.
Zones are primarily used to configure alarms.
An example of using a zone is when creating a "Zone exit" alarm.
This alarm will be triggered when a tracked object leaves a zone.

Creating, editing, and deleting zones is available from *Settings/Zones*.
