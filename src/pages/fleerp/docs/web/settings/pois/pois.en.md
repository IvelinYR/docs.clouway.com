# Points of interest (POIs)

The term Point of Interest refers to the location of different places or sites of interest to the user. These can be places such as hotels, restaurants, gas stations and others.

In the Fleerp system, the user may create an alarm that occurs when a tracking object intersects a point of interest with given tag.

After clicking on the "POIs" menu in the settings section of the system Fleerp, a screen showing all available POIs will be displayed.
