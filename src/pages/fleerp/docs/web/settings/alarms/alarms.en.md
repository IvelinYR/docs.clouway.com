# Alarms

Having multiple tracking objects available, the user will have difficulty monitoring each of them.
The alarms are one of the most important tools with which the user can easily control all tracking objects
by creating alarms that give synthesized information about that, what violations are done.

Basic functions:

- create a new alarm;
- edit alarm;
- suspend alarm;
- delete alarm;
