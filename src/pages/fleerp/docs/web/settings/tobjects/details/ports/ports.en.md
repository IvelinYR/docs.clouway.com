Generally digital ports are used for data, with has exactly two states - on or off.

Example use of digital port:

- vehicle key on/off;

On the other hand, analog sensors operate by volt supply, which means they have indefinite states.

- recording battery voltage;
- recording temperature;
- recording fuel level;
