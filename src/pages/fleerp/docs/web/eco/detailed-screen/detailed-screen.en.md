# Detailed screen

The detailed screen allows the user to see the eco rating, which is calculated by several different factors:

- The mileage travelled for the selected time frame
- The types of penalties that the object received, as well as their number

![Detailed-screen](detailed-screen-en.png)

The rating is shown in the left portion of the screen, in the right portion - the percent ratio of the penalties, that
the object has received.

The types of penalties are as follows:

- Harsh braking
- Harsh cornering
- Harsh acceleration
- Overspeed
- Idling

The system provides a tool for initial configuration or corrections in the sensitivity settings of the accelerometer of
a given device through the [_console_](../../web/settings/tobjects/details/console).
