# Side panel

The side panel combines several key features:

- Picking a time frame for generating an eco report
- Filtering by name or licence plate number
- Listing all drivers and vehicles, which do not have driver token reader installed
- Selection of a concrete driver or vehicle

### Picking a time frame

Picking a time frame for which eco report will be generated is accomplished by clicking on the already
selected dates, and picking new ones from the calendar that will appear:

It has to be noted that the maximum time frame, which the system allows to be picked for generating eco report, is one month.

### Filtering by name or licence plate number

The name and licence plate number filter provides easy filtration, in case the organization has many drivers or vehicles.

### Drivers and vehicles list, and their selection

The drivers and vehicles are sorted in descending order by their current eco rating.
